<p> Mazar-e-Quaid (Urdu: مزارِ قائد, lit. 'Mausoleum of the Leader') is the resting place of Muhammad Ali Jinnah situated in Karachi, Sindh. The marble monument comprises a surface area of 3,100 square metres (33,000 square feet). It is surrounded by formal gardens and designed in an Islamic modernist style.[1]

    Following Jinnah's death in 1948, his tomb was capped by a small dome and remained in poor conditions. In 1957, the Government of Pakistan held an international competition for the design of the mausoleum. The design of the victorious William Whitfield attained prominent distinction, though his work was rejected by Jinnah's sister Fatima. She sought the support of the public and subsequently approved the design of Jinnah's close friend Yahya Merchant in 1960. The mausoleum's construction concluded in 1971 and was inaugurated by Yahya Khan, the then-president of Pakistan.
    
    Mazar-e-Quaid is regarded as one of the iconic monuments of Pakistan. Along with Jinnah, it entombs several other activists of the Pakistan Movement, making it a common place for celebrations of the Independence Day in the country.</p>
