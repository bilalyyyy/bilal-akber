<p>Daman-e-Koh (Urdu: دامن کوہ) is a viewing point and hill top garden north of Islamabad and located in the middle of the Margalla Hills. Its name is a conjunction of two Persian words, which together means foot hills. It is about 2400 ft from sea level and almost 500 ft from the city of Islamabad. It is a popular destination for the residents as well as the visitors to the capital.

    Daman-e-Koh is a midpoint on the road to Pir Sohawa which is located at the top of Margalla Hills at an elevation of about 3600 ft. The popularity of the site regularly leads to traffic jams due to the absence of public transport options on the narrow, winding road. There is a plan to construct a chairlift from Daman-e-Koh to Pir Sohawa.
    
    Monkeys are a common sight attracted by the food given by tourists. Cheetahs are frequently reported to descend from higher hills of Murree during snowfall.
