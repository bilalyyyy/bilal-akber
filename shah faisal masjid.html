 <p>The Faisal Mosque (Urdu: فیصل مسجد, romanized: faisal masjid) is the national mosque of Pakistan, located in capital Islamabad.[1][2] It is the fifth-largest mosque in the world and the largest within South Asia, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad. It is named after the late King Faisal I of Saudi Arabia. The mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by the design of a typical Bedouin tent.[3]

    A major tourist attraction in Pakistan, the mosque is a contemporary and influential piece of Islamic architecture.[4][5]
    
    Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $28 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears.[6] The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition.[7][4] Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 feet (79 m) tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.[8]
    
    Combined the structure covers an area of 33 acres (130,000 m2; 1,400,000 sq ft), the mosque dominates the landscape of Islamabad.[6] It is situated at the north end of Faisal Avenue, putting it at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla Hills, the westernmost foothills of the Himalayas. It is located on an elevated area of land against a picturesque backdrop of the national park. Faisal Mosque was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993 when it was overtaken by the mosques in Saudi Arabia. Faisal Mosque is now the sixth largest mosque in the world in terms of capacity.[9][10</p>
