<p>Nathia Gali or Nathiagali (Urdu: نتھیا گلی) is a hill station and mountain resort town located in the Abbottabad District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is located at the centre of the Galyat range, where several hill stations are situated. Nathia Gali is known for its scenic beauty, hiking tracks and pleasant weather, which is much cooler than the rest of the Galyat range due to it being at a higher altitude. It is situated approximately 32 kilometres (20 mi) away from both Murree and Abbottabad.[2][3]</p>
